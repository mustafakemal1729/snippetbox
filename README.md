# Snippetbox

## Overview

Snippetbox is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built with Go, MySQL, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It serves as a training project to learn how to build production-ready web applications with Go, inspired by the concepts introduced in Alex Edwards' "Letâ€™s Go" book.
